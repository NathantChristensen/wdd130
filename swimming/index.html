            <h2>Goal Statement</h2>
            <p>Imagine that you are at a pool party at your friend’s home. You are invited to go out into the pool to swim, but you refuse the offer because you never learned how to swim as a kid. Growing up in Colorado your parents never knew about any swim school that they could afford to send you to, and so you never learned. This is a situation that we hope to combat for any parent living near Colorado Springs, Colorado. Miss Alaine’s Swim School is an affordable option for those who are looking to teach their child to swim, and on this site, you will find all the needed information to contact us and sign your child up to start swim lessons.</p>

            <h2>Overview of Typical Swim Lesson</h2>
            <p>Lessons generally take an hour or two to complete. Your child will be in the pool for most of that time, and parents will be required to be there to pick the child up an hour after the start time.</p>
