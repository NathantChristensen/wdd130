Growing up in Colorado your parents never knew about any swim school that they could afford to send you to, and so you never learned. For any parent living near Elbert, Colorado Miss Alaine’s Swim School is an affordable option for those who are looking to teach their child to swim. On this site, you will find all the needed information to contact and sign your child up to start swim lessons here in Elbert, Colorado.</p>  <!-- change this -->
